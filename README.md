## My process

Below is my thinking process of Java Script code:

1. Created consts
2. Created a function that shows errors on a website
3. Created a function that set my website to default mode (clears error)
4. Created a function that validate my email input (regexp + .test)
5. Created a function that checks if my input is empty (show errors if it is)
6. Created a function that clear my input field and console log my email if I submit correct data
7. Created event on a button

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid and Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I managed to do this challenge in 5 hours. I'm not happy with my challenge result. I should have added position absolute on my button to repair border-error on my input. I should have added a wrapper while I was coding html sheet, because I had some problems with positioning my desktop view. Also I know I have set background image wrong, it comes over my image, which is not a good idea. Anyway, I learned how to add image to input, how to use linear gradient and I have worked with my grid skills.
