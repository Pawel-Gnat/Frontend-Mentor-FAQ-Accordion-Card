## My process

Below is my thinking process of Java Script code:

1. Created consts
2. Created an if function that add or remove active class on elements
3. Created a function that close my accordion text and rotate an arrow
4. Created a function that close my accordion while I clicked somewhere else
5. Created event on buttons using forEach
6. Created event that call "clickoutside" function out

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I struggled to do this challenge in 15 hours. I had a really hard times with javascript, images and toggling accordeon with arrow. I learned A LOT (css selectors, ::after pseudoelement), but I still think this challenge was hard. I didn't like that bold font on button focus, so I decided to not code it.
